# Reference
- [Inflean - Real Turn Game Making in Unity](https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EC%9C%A0%EB%8B%88%ED%8B%B0-%EC%BF%BC%ED%84%B0%EB%B7%B0-%ED%84%B4%EC%A0%9C-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84/dashboard)

# Execution
- RPG_Game Zip Unzipped
- RPG_Game exe Run

# Improvement points
- There was no shutdown button in the existing program, so a new shutdown button had to be created. (ESC)
- There is a bug in which turns are repeated, and the turn is currently being changed so that only one turn is turned.
